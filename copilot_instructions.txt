# COMPREHENSIVE CODE QUALITY & ARCHITECTURE AUDIT

## AUDIT SCOPE
Audit the following directory: `src/{folder_name}`

---

## PART 1: DOCSTRING AUDIT
For each .py file:
1. Check module-level docstrings exist and describe purpose
2. Check all classes have docstrings with description
3. Check all public methods have Google-style docstrings:
   - Description (ends with period)
   - Args section (if parameters exist)
   - Returns section (if return value exists)
   - Raises section (if exceptions are raised)
4. Fix any missing or incomplete docstrings
5. Verify syntax with: `python -m py_compile <file>`

---

## PART 2: CODE QUALITY STANDARDS
Check and fix:
- [ ] **Imports**: Organized (stdlib → third-party → local), no unused imports
- [ ] **Naming**: snake_case for functions/variables, PascalCase for classes
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Specific exceptions, proper logging, no bare `except:`
- [ ] **DRY**: No code duplication across files
- [ ] **Single Responsibility**: Each file/class has one clear purpose
- [ ] **Type Hints**: Function parameters and return types annotated

---

## PART 3: ARCHITECTURE AUDIT
Analyze and report:
1. **Dependency Flow**: Are imports one-directional? Any circular dependencies?
2. **Layer Separation**: UI → Core → Database layers properly isolated?
3. **Integration Points**: How do components communicate?
4. **Missing Integrations**: What should be connected but isn't?
5. **Singleton Usage**: Correct implementation (ConfigManager, MT5Connector)?

---

## PART 4: FILE ORGANIZATION
Check:
- [ ] No root directory clutter (move to appropriate folders)
- [ ] All .md files in `docs/` (except README.md)
- [ ] Test files in `tests/{unit|integration|e2e}/`
- [ ] Templates in single `templates/` folder
- [ ] Deprecated files archived or removed

---

## PART 5: TEST COVERAGE
For each file audited:
1. Identify corresponding test file in `tests/unit/`
2. Check test coverage for all public methods
3. Add missing test cases if needed
4. Run tests: `python run_tests.py`
5. Expected: 729 tests passing, 5/6 suites PASS

---

## DELIVERABLES
After audit:
1. List all files modified with change count
2. Summarize integration gaps found
3. Confirm all tests pass
4. Report any architectural concerns

---

## VERIFICATION COMMANDS
```bash
# Compile check
python -m py_compile src/{folder}/*.py

# Run tests
python run_tests.py

# Pylint check (errors only)
pylint src/{folder} --disable=all --enable=E,F
```

---

## QUICK AUDIT VARIANTS

### Docstring-Only:
```
Audit docstrings in src/{folder} .py files:
- Fix missing Args, Returns, Raises sections
- Add periods at end of sentences
- Verify compile and run tests
```

### Architecture-Only:
```
Perform architecture audit of src/:
- Map import dependencies between modules
- Identify circular dependencies
- Check layer isolation (UI → Core → Data → DB)
- Report integration gaps
```

### Test Coverage:
```
Audit test coverage for src/{folder}:
- List all public methods
- Check tests/unit/test_{module}.py exists
- Add missing test cases
- Run full test suite
```
